No working compiler found, or bogus compiler options passed to the compiler from Python's standard "distutils" module.  See the error messages above.  Likely, the problem is not related to CFFI but generic to the setup.py of any Python package that tries to compile C code.  (Hints: on OS/X 10.8, for errors about -mno-fused-madd see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22313407/ Otherwise, see https://wiki.python.org/moin/CompLangPython or the IRC channel #python on irc.libera.chat.)
